Prompt: Amtrak Records Retention Schedule (Design)


Amtrak’s current Records Retention Schedule is a 75-page PDF that outlines record-keeping policies but lacks an intuitive system for organization, searchability, and management. To improve efficiency and accessibility, we designed a more user-friendly system tailored to Amtrak’s needs. Our approach began with a critical analysis of the existing document, identifying key issues such as missing values, slow retrieval times for users, and a lack of structured update processes. Rather than converting the PDF into a simple spreadsheet, we opted for the concept of a dynamic system which would provide users access to the information while maintaining administrative control over updates and other factors in the hands of management.

Through user research, including discussions with key stakeholders like Maria Buccieri (Senior Director at Amtrak), we mapped out department-specific workflows and permissions based on the current and future features Amtrak aims to have with the schedule. Through an initial sign-on, we were able to ensure that only administrators could modify records while users could view schedules and request updates. By developing these user personas and sketching interaction flows, we were able to craft a system that enhances readability, usability, and accessibility. Overall, our design incorporates features such as; 1) A personalized dashboard based on user type, 2) Ability to contact designated administrators for inquiries, 3) Ease of access to personalized schedules, notifications, settings, 4) An AI help bot, and 5) Other administrative specific tools. We also strived to incorporate as many details as possible based on the information we were provided, such as aligning with Amtrak’s current brand, including but not limited to; color scheme, partnerships (i.e. Microsoft), and scope of Amtrak’s intranet. The final product, The RRS as we like to call it, offers the intuitive and efficient solution for managing Amtrak’s Records Retention Schedule.
